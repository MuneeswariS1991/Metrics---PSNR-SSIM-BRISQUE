# Metrics---PSNR-SSIM-BRISQUE
BRISQUE is statistically better than the full-reference peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and the structural similarity index (SSIM) and highly competitive with respect to all present-day distortion-generic NR IQA algorithms. PSNR and SSIM are the two most representative FR methods, BIQI , BRISQUE and NIQE are the state-of-the-art NR IQA methods. to show that BRISQUE is statistically better than the full-reference peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and the structural similarity index (SSIM) and highly competitive with respect to all present-day distortion-generic NR IQA algorithms.
